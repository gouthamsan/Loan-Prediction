# Loan-prediction-using-Machine-Learning-and-Python #

## Aim ##

Our aim from the project is to make use of pandas, matplotlib, & seaborn libraries from python to extract insights from the data and xgboost, & scikit-learn libraries for machine learning.

Secondly, to learn how to hypertune the parameters using grid search cross validation for the xgboost machine learning model.

And in the end, to predict whether the loan applicant can replay the loan or not using voting ensembling techniques of combining the predictions from multiple machine learning algorithms.

## Attributes in the dataset ##

Loan id, Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self Employed, Applicant income, Coapplicant income, Loan Amount,Credit History, Property_Area, Loan_Status
